He sets out to compute the greatest possible value of\\[\\dfrac1{r_1^{2008}}+\\dfrac1{r_2^{2008}}.\\]Help Michael by computing this maximum.\nassistant\n", "response": "boxed{2}", "reward": 0.5, "global_step": 53, "epoch": -1.0, "batch_id": "step53_fullbuffer_20250331_215256", "timestamp": 1743429176.2482872, "datetime": "2025-03-31T21:52:56.248287", "batch_size": 32, "avg_reward": 0.012499998789280653, "max_reward": 0.5, "min_reward": -0.10000000149011612, "total_samples_saved_so_far": 1696, "sample_metadata": {"original_id": "83b7f927-752f-49bc-a36e-accae2130692", "batch_id": "step53_fullbuffer_20250331_215256", "position_in_buffer": 0, "global_position": 1664, "reward_value": 0.5, "reward_normalized": 1.0, "timestamp": 1743429176.2481973, "datetime": "2025-03-31T21:52:56.248197"}}
