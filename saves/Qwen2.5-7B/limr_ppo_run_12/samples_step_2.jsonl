If exactly two of these families are childless, what is the average number of children in the families with children? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nassistant\n", "response": "To determine the average number of children in the families with children, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of children among all ten families:**\n\n   Given the average number of children per family is 2, and there are 10 families, we use the formula for the average:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of children} = \\text{Average number of children per family} \\times \\text{Number of families}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of children} = 2 \\times 10 = 20\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of families with children:**\n\n   We know that exactly two families are childless.
