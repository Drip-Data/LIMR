Here, \\( a \\) is the hundreds digit, \\( b \\) is the tens digit, and \\( c \\) is the units digit. Since it is an even number, the units digit \\( c \\) must be one of the even digits: 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. Additionally, we are given that the sum of the tens and units digits is 10, so \\( b + c = 10 \\).\n\nLet's analyze each possible value for \\( c \\):\n\n1. If \\( c = 0 \\), then \\( b = 10 - 0 = 10 \\). However, \\( b \\) cannot be 10 because it is a digit (it must be between 0 and 9). Therefore, there are no valid combinations for \\( c = 0 \\).\n2. If \\( c = 2 \\), then \\( b = 10 - 2 = 8 \\). This is a valid combination. The hundreds digit \\( a \\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 choices).\n3. If \\( c = 4 \\), then \\( b = 10 - 4 = 6 \\). This is a valid combination. The hundreds digit \\( a \\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 choices).\n4. If \\( c = 6 \\), then \\( b = 10 - 6 = 4 \\). This is a valid combination.

A container is selected at random and then a ball is randomly selected from that container. What is the probability that the ball selected is green? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nassistant\n", "response": "To find the probability that the ball selected is green, we need to consider the probability of selecting each container and the probability of selecting a green ball from each container. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the probability of selecting each container. Since we are selecting a container at random, the probability of selecting any one of the containers is:\n\\[ P(A) = P(B) = P(C) = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the probability of selecting a green ball from each container. For container A, which has 4 red balls and 6 green balls, the probability of selecting a green ball is:\n\\[ P(\\text{green} \\mid A) = \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5} \\]\n\nFor container B, which has 6 red balls and 4 green balls, the probability of selecting a green ball is:\n\\[ P(\\text{green} \\mid B) = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5} \\]\n\nFor container C, which has 6 red balls and 4 green balls, the probability of selecting a green ball is:\n\\[ P(\\text{green} \\mid C) = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5} \\]\n\nNow, we use the law of total probability to find the overall probability of selecting a green ball.
